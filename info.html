<p>Welcome to Fontool! This tiny little app can help you to test webfonts. It is focussing on the following aspects:</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Overall readability</strong></p>

<p>Is it friendly to read and suitable for large amounts of text?</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Rendering</strong> </p>

<p>How well does the font perform on different platforms, browsers and devices? Is it well hinted so that it looks good on windows?</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Formal criteria</strong></p>

<p>Does your font meet the right temper, is it legible?</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Language support</strong></p>

<p>Some languages hold very special characters which you might need. Modern browsers often fake missing charaters but this wouldn’t work on older versions of IE or some mobile browsers. Thats why this demo features hungarian too, just in case.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Fallback</strong></p>
<p>What happens if the font wouldn’t load?</p>
<h2>Who it is for</h2>
<p>This is a very simple solution to scrutinize your font of choice for the aspects mentioned above. Wether you are from a Brand, UX, Visual or Interaction design field I hope this can contribute to your workflow.
The purpose is to rule out complicated font choices early in the design process. At the moment this works with google fonts and it would also load fonts installed on your system although it will throw an error.
</p>
<h2>In the planning</h2>
<p>I will add more funcionality in the future, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Font information (origins, available families, license) and Specimen.</li>
  <li>Integration with Typekit and font upload.</li>
  <li>Maybe custom text editing</li>
  <li>Continouus integration of further languages</li>
  <li>Suggestions and feedback are always welcome.</li>
</ul>
